Maybe the right size for your company is five people. Maybe it’s forty. Maybe it’s two hundred. Or maybe it’s just you and a laptop. Don’t make assumptions about how big you should be ahead of time. Grow slow and see what feels right—premature hiring is the death of many companies. And avoid huge growth spurts too—they can cause you to skip right over your appropriate size. Small is not just a stepping-stone. Small is a great destination in itself. Have you ever noticed that while small businesses wish they were bigger, big businesses dream about being more agile and flexible? And remember, once you get big, it’s really hard to shrink without firing people, damaging morale, and changing the entire way you do business. Ramping up doesn’t have to be your goal. And we’re not talking just about the number of employees you have either. It’s also true for expenses, rent, IT infrastructure, furniture, etc. These things don’t just happen to you. You decide whether or not to take them on. And if you do take them on, you’ll be taking on new headaches, too. Lock in lots of expenses and you force yourself into building a complex businesss—one that’s a lot more difficult and stressful to run. Don’t be insecure about aiming to be a small business. Anyone who runs a business that’s sustainable and profitable, whether it’s big or small, should be proud.

Workaholics wind up creating more problems than they solve. First off, working like that just isn’t sustainable over time. When the burnout crash comes—and it will—it’ll hit that much harder. Workaholics miss the point, too. They try to fix problems by throwing sheer hours at them. They try to make up for intellectual laziness with brute force. This results in inelegant solutions.

The global anticulture that has been conveyed into every cranny of the world by television is a culture unto itself, and by the standards of great and ancient cultures like Islam and France, it seems grossly inferior, at least at first. The only good thing you can say about it is that it makes world wars and Holocausts less likely—and that is actually a pretty good thing! The only real problem is that anyone who has no culture, other than this global monoculture, is completely screwed. Anyone who grows up watching TV, never sees any religion or philosophy, is raised in an atmosphere of moral relativism, learns about civics from watching bimbo eruptions on network TV news, and attends a university where postmodernists vie to outdo each other in demolishing traditional notions of truth and quality, is going to come out into the world as one pretty feckless human being. And—again—perhaps the goal of all this is to make us feckless so we won’t nuke each other.

below a certain size—way below the level of quarks, down into the realm of string theory—the universe can’t be described very well by physics as it has been practiced since the days of Newton. If you look at a small enough scale, you see processes that look almost computational in nature. I think that the message is very clear here: somewhere outside of and beyond our universe is an operating system, coded up over incalculable spans of time by some kind of hacker-demiurge. The cosmic operating system uses a command line interface. It runs on something like a teletype, with lots of noise and heat; punched-out bits flutter down into its hopper like drifting stars. The demiurge sits at his teletype, pounding out one command line after another, specifying the values of fundamental constants of physics:

Conan’s philosophy is best expressed in one passage from Queen of the Black Coast: “In this world men struggle and suffer vainly, finding pleasure only in the bright madness of battle … Let me live deep while I live; let me know the rich juices of red meat and stinging wine on my palate, the hot embrace of white arms, the mad exultation of battle when the blue blades flame and crimson, and I am content. Let teachers and priests and philosophers brood over questions of reality and illusion. I know this: if life is illusion, then I am no less an illusion, and being thus, the illusion is real to me. I live, I burn with life, I love, I slay, and am content.”

Greg said he’d discovered the concept of PT after embarking on a libertarian reading jag. Ayn Rand’s classic tome on capitalism and individualism, Atlas Shrugged, had led him to former Libertarian Party presidential candidate Harry Browne’s influential How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World. From there, he’d picked up Sic Itur Ad Astra (This Is the Way to the Stars), a workbook by the astrophysicist Andrew J. Galambos on how to build a society based on personal freedom. And this had led him to the writings of a man known by the pseudonym W. G. Hill.

But these are just wants. Happiness, friendship, education, entertainment, success, family, respect, freedom of speech—those are wants too. Our needs are actually very few. Here is all we need: 1. Safety and health: In short, the confidence of knowing we’ll wake up each day in satisfactory working order, without a knife held to our throat or a hurricane tearing our roof off or a disease attacking our body. 2. Shelter and warmth: According to the rule of threes, though we can live without water for roughly three days and without food for some three weeks, it can take just three hours to die of exposure. 3. Food and water: No explanation necessary. That’s it. Call it the triangle of life. When it comes down to it, every one of us would sacrifice our freedom to fulfill any one of these three needs if they were lacking.

What concerns you the most in life? 2. What does it mean to live a good, fulfilled life? 3. What’s the problem with mankind and what’s the solution? (Interestingly, Forti added, out of nearly a thousand interviews in over a hundred different cultures, no one replied that there was no problem with mankind.) 4. What happens after you die? 5.

I’d recently read a book called Patriots by an infamous survival blogger named James Wesley Rawles. A how-to book disguised as fiction, Patriots tells of a future in which inflation has made the dollar worthless, leading to social, economic, and government collapse. Fortunately, a group of eight friends has been training and stockpiling supplies for years—Just in Case. So they hole up in a compound in rural Idaho and, thanks to their military organization, survival skills, Christian values, and weapons expertise, successfully fend off looters, gangs, and even the United Nations. The lengths they go to in order to accomplish this are not just extreme, they’re inspirational.

Every time I watch a global warming documentary, every time I read the signs in a national park, every time I talk to environmentalists, I feel the same frustration. I understand their points, but their premise is flawed. It seems arrogant to say that everything not just on this planet, but in the universe, is natural, yet that man somehow defies nature or is not part of it. Is it because we are able to shape our environment? Beavers building a dam shape their environment, as do birds building a nest. Is it because we hurt our environment? So do predators like sharks, viruses like avian influenza, and vines like liana, which are strangling trees in the Amazon and contributing to global warming. Is it because we are the only animal on the planet that reflects on its own existence and believes in a God? Not all of us do. And there are other animals that have unique traits too: the tuatara is the only animal with three eyes, but it’s not unnatural – it’s just different. So if we are to admit that mankind is part of nature, I thought as I drove off the dirt roads of the Commonweal Garden and back onto the pavement, spewing exhaust into the atmosphere, then why is anything that we do wrong? Some say we are destroying the earth, but we are fortunately not that powerful. We can only change parts of the earth and the environment, so that they are no longer sustainable to human life. But the earth will go on. For a while, at least. Like a fruit fly, like a human being, like a species, like a star, like a sitcom, the earth has a life cycle with a beginning, a middle, and an end. That end may come from a black hole, a planetary collision, or, most likely, the sun when it evolves into what’s known as a red giant and engulfs the earth in five billion years. But that doesn’t mean that the sun is bad or evil or unnatural. It’s just living its life and doing its job. So who is to say that we are not just doing the job that nature assigned us. And maybe the permaculturists and activists and politicians who complain of global warming and overfishing and deforestation and toxic waste dumping are actually standing in the way of nature. When it comes down to it, what we are doing is not unnatural. It is only inhumane. Because the only people we’re hurting are ourselves, our descendants, and our most closely related life forms. The Earth will be just fine. It has always had and will continue to have climactic changes that support some life forms and make others extinct. And if the Earth isn’t fine, then that’s just part of nature too. Nature knows no catastrophes. Only man does. And when we’re gone, the universe won’t miss us. It doesn’t know about things like good and bad. It just knows creation and destruction. So don’t waste your time looking for the meaning of life, because there is none. There’s just a process of life.

Too much time in academia can actually do you harm. Take writing, for example. When you get out of school, you have to unlearn so much of the way they teach you to write there. Some of the misguided lessons you learn in academia: The longer a document is, the more it matters. Stiff, formal tone is better than being conversational. Using big words is impressive. You need to write a certain number of words or pages to make a point. The format matters as much (or more) than the content of what you write. It’s no wonder so much business writing winds up dry, wordy, and dripping with nonsense. People are just continuing the bad habits they picked up in school. It’s not just academic writing, either. There are a lot of skills that are useful in academia that aren’t worth much outside of it.

I was perplexed by the failure of teachers at school to address what seemed the most urgent matter of all: the bewildering, stomach-churning insecurity of being alive. The standard subjects of history, geography, mathematics, and English seemed perversely designed to ignore the questions that really mattered. As soon as I had some inkling of what “philosophy” meant, I was puzzled as to why we were not taught it. And my skepticism about religion only grew as I failed to see what the vicars and priests I encountered gained from their faith. They struck me either as insincere, pious, and aloof or just bumblingly good-natured. As the 1960s unfolded, I was

Rather than saying that ultimately everything was empty of inherent existence, as I had been taught until then, Dharmakirti maintained that the changing, functional, causal, and conditioned world, present to ordinary sensory and mental experience, was what was ultimately real. To be real, in Dharmakirti’s terms, means to be capable of producing effects in the concrete world. Thus a seed, a jug, wind in the trees, a desire, a thought, the pain in one’s knees, another person: these are what are real. Emptiness of inherent existence, by contrast, is just a conceptual and linguistic abstraction. It may serve as a strategic idea, but it lacks the vital reality of a rosebud, the beating of one’s heart, or a crying child. The aim of meditation, for Dharmakirti, was not to gain mystical insight into emptiness, but to arrive at an unfiltered experience of the fluctuating, contingent, and suffering world. What prevents you from experiencing the world in such a way? The problem lies in the instinctive human conviction that one is a permanent, partless, and autonomous self, essentially disconnected from and unaffected by flux and contingency. This conviction may provide a sense of security and permanence in an insecure and impermanent world, but the price one pays is that of alienation, disenchantment, and boredom. One feels cut off from the life around oneself, adrift in a self-referring world of one’s own imagining. For Dharmakirti, however, the point is not to dwell on the absence or emptiness of such a disconnected ego, but to encounter the phenomenal world in all its vitality and immediacy once such a conception of self begins to fade. I can best illustrate this with an example. When my wife and I bought our house in France, a large wooden shed stood in the garden just behind the house itself. The shed cut out the light and blocked the view. Moreover, it had become overgrown with honeysuckle and ivy, so that its size increased year by year, darkening the shadow it cast and increasing the rank humidity in the passage between it and the house. It was packed with obsolete German industrial machinery that had not been touched in decades. Its only virtue, and the main argument for keeping it, was that the local feral cats used it as a place to have their kittens. Finally, we got rid of the shed. Once that year’s batch of kittens was gone, we sold the machinery as scrap metal and invited our friend Paco, who needed the wood, to dismantle it. In the course of an afternoon, something that had been such a gloomy presence for so long was suddenly not there anymore. For the next few days, I would stand where it had once stood and consciously delight in its absence. The dark, dank passage it created had vanished. House and garden were transformed. Light poured into the downstairs windows, and hitherto unknown vistas of the garden and surrounding countryside opened up. After a few days, the rapturous experience of “no shed” faded. I forgot about the shed that had once been there and was no longer struck by its absence. I simply attended to the garden and house as they now were. For Dharmakirti, the experience of “emptiness” or “not-self” is like this. To realize the absence of a permanent, partless, autonomous ego enables hitherto unknown vistas in one’s life to open up. The dark, opaque perspective of self-centeredness gives way to a more luminous and sensitized awareness of the shifting, contingent processes of body and mind. Once one gets used to this, one ceases to notice the absence of such a self. It is replaced by another way of living in this world with others, which, after a while, becomes entirely unremarkable. To keep insisting on “emptiness” as something sacred and special would be like erecting a shrine in the garden to the absence of the shed instead of getting on with the gardening.

Heidegger’s ideas, I wrote on April 27, 1979, “have the thrill of a voyage into unexplored regions; often the steps to be taken produce a fear and sense of danger, at other times his words break through like an opening into a valley.” Heidegger had entirely abandoned any dualistic assumption of a separation between mind and matter. In Being and Time, he speaks of the primary human experience as one of “being-in-the-world.” This is the foundation upon which all distinctions such as “subject” and “object,” “mind” and “matter” are subsequently imposed. Because we have become so familiar with such distinctions, we assume them to inhere within the structure of being itself. Yet, for Heidegger, our condition is fundamentally not divided along these or any such lines at all.

He confidently told me just to look into the nature of my mind and ask myself: ‘What is this?’” When the retreat began and I started meditating in earnest on the question “What is this?” my mind insisted on coming up with clever answers. Each time I tried to discuss my latest theory with Kusan Sunim, he would listen patiently for a while, then give a short laugh and say: “Bopchon [my Korean name]. Do you know what it is? No? Then go back and sit.” Irrespective of how suitably enigmatic they seemed, my answers were either trite or predictable. After a while, I simply gave up trying to find an answer. “What is this?” is an impossible question: it is designed to short-circuit the brain’s answer-giving habit and leave you in a state of serene puzzlement. This doubt, or “perplexity” as I preferred to call it, then slowly starts to infuse one’s consciousness as a whole. Rather than struggling with the words of the question, one settles into a mood of quiet focused astonishment, in which one simply waits and listens in the pregnant silence that follows the fading of the words.

By the time I left Switzerland, questions had become far more interesting to me than answers. For eight years, my Tibetan teachers had sought to convince me that the answers to the great questions of life were enshrined in their hermetic system of beliefs. The aim of their training had been to arrive at certainty: to reach a place where all questions had finally been resolved and all doubt vanquished. From their point of view, I had failed. While I valued the rich framework of Buddhist ideas they had given me, I could neither submit myself unquestioningly to the authority of the lamas nor uncritically accept their view of the world and the place of humans within it. The problem with certainty is that it is static; it can do little but endlessly reassert itself. Uncertainty, by contrast, is full of unknowns, possibilities, and risks. The certainties of Tibetan Buddhism had had a suffocating effect upon me, while the uncertainty celebrated in Korean Zen brought me vividly, if anxiously, to life.

Kalamas, when you know for yourselves: these things are bad, these things are blamable; these things are censured by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to harm and ill: then abandon them.” This unambiguous call for the valuing of uncertainty and the need to establish the truth of things for oneself rather than rely on the authority of others struck a deep chord within me. The Buddha encourages the Kalamas to observe for themselves the consequences of greed, hatred, and stupidity on human beings, so they can judge for themselves what thoughts and acts lead to harm and suffering and which do not. His sole criterion for evaluating a doctrine is whether it causes or mitigates suffering.

The Kalama Sutta presents a vision of the Buddha’s teaching that goes against the grain of much Buddhist orthodoxy. Rather than deference to tradition and lineage, it celebrates self-reliance; rather than belief in doctrine, it stresses the importance of testing ideas to see if they work; and rather than insisting on a metaphysics of rebirth and karma, it suggests that this world might indeed be the only one there is.

the metaphysical questions the Buddha refuses to comment upon. These are some of the “big” questions to which religions claim to provide the answers: Is the universe eternal or not eternal? Is it finite or infinite? Is the mind the same as or different from the body? Does one continue to exist after death or not? The Buddha dismisses such questions, because to pursue them would not contribute to cultivating the kind of path he teaches. He compares a person who is preoccupied with such speculations to a man who has been wounded by a poisoned arrow but refuses to have it removed until he knows “the name and clan of the person who fired it; whether the bow was a longbow or a crossbow; whether the arrow was hoof-tipped, curved or barbed.” The only legitimate concern for such a person would be the removal of the arrow.

Each blind person is invited to touch a different part of the animal. The one holding the trunk declares that the elephant is a tube; the one feeling the side says that the elephant is a wall; while the one holding the tail is convinced that the elephant is a rope. Thus preoccupation with metaphysics not only fails to address the primary issue of suffering, but also leads to a partial and distorted picture of the complex totality of the human situation.

Gotama’s quest led him to abandon everything to do with his place—his king, his homeland, his social standing, his position in the family, his beliefs, his conviction of being a self in charge of a body and mind—but it did not result in psychotic collapse. For in relinquishing his place (ālaya), he arrived at a ground (hāna). But this ground is quite unlike the seemingly solid ground of a place. It is the contingent, transient, ambiguous, unpredictable, fascinating, and terrifying ground called “life.” Life is a groundless ground: no sooner does it appear, than it disappears, only to renew itself, then immediately break up and vanish again. It pours forth endlessly, like the river of Heraclitus into which one cannot step twice. If you try to grasp it, it slips away between your fingers. This groundless ground is not the absence of support. It supports you in a different way. Whereas a place can tie you down and close you off, this ground lets you go and opens you up. It does not stand still for a moment. To be supported by it, you have to be with it in a different way. Instead of standing firmly on your feet and holding on tight with both hands in order to feel secure in your place, here you have to dart across its liquid, shimmering surface like a long-legged fly, swim with its current like a fast-moving fish. Gotama compared the experience to “entering a stream.”

He spoke only of waking up to a contingent ground—“this-conditionality, conditioned arising”—that until then had been obscured by his attachment to a fixed position. While such an awakening is bound to lead to a reconsideration of what one “knows,” the awakening itself is not primarily a cognitive act. It is an existential readjustment, a seismic shift in the core of oneself and one’s relation to others and the world. Rather than providing Gotama with a set of ready-made answers to life’s big questions, it allowed him to respond to those questions from an entirely new perspective.

To live on this shifting ground, one first needs to stop obsessing about what has happened before and what might happen later. One needs to be more vitally conscious of what is happening now. This is not to deny the reality of past and future. It is about embarking on a new relationship with the impermanence and temporality of life. Instead of hankering after the past and speculating about the future, one sees the present as the fruit of what has been and the germ of what will be. Gotama did not encourage withdrawal to a timeless, mystical now, but an unflinching encounter with the contingent world as it unravels moment to moment.

I seem to be hardwired to experience my self and the world in this way. Yet despite the undeniable evidence of my own eyes, I know that the earth sets and rises, not the sun. Gotama did for the self what Copernicus did for the earth: he put it in its rightful place, despite its continuing to appear just as it did before. Gotama no more rejected the existence of the self than Copernicus rejected the existence of the earth. Instead, rather than regarding it as a fixed, non-contingent point around which everything else turned, he recognized that each self was a fluid, contingent process just like everything else.

At the same time, one of the most unsettling memories of my youth is of an occasion when my mother inadvertently challenged my instinctive certainty of being “me.” It was Christmas, and I must have been about sixteen. My mother and her sister, my aunt Betty, were leafing through a volume of photographs on the kitchen table. They came to a snapshot of a man in military fatigues—eyes squinting against the desert sun, pipe clenched between teeth. My mother said to me: “If things had worked out differently, he would have been your father.” I thought: But if that man had been my father, would I have been me? This led me to wonder: If another of my actual father’s myriad spermatozoa impregnated my mother’s ovum, would the child born from such a mingling of chromosomes have been me? Or had the same spermatozoon burrowed home in her next ovarian cycle, would that baby have been me? Despite such unnerving glimpses of my own contingency, the conviction of my being a permanent, timeless witness has remained as steady and self-evident to me as the view I have of the sun rising every morning in the east, crossing the sky, then setting in the west. I seem to be hardwired to experience my self and the world in this way. Yet despite the undeniable evidence of my own eyes, I know that the earth sets and rises, not the sun. Gotama did for the self what Copernicus did for the earth: he put it in its rightful place, despite its continuing to appear just as it did before. Gotama no more rejected the existence of the self than Copernicus rejected the existence of the earth. Instead, rather than regarding it as a fixed, non-contingent point around which everything else turned, he recognized that each self was a fluid, contingent process just like everything else.

Gotama declared that his awakening to the contingent ground of life went “against the stream.” It was counterintuitive. It went against the instinctive sense of being a timeless witness of one’s experience. It contradicted the belief in an eternal soul and, by implication, in the transcendent reality of God. Rather than disassociating oneself from the world in order to achieve union with God, Gotama encouraged his followers to pay close, penetrating attention to the rise and fall of the phenomenal world itself.

The metaphors he used to describe the practice of mindfulness are earthy and practical. He compared the meditator to a skilled woodturner and butcher, men who have learned to use their tools with extraordinary precision, who can shape a piece of wood or dissect a carcass with minimal effort and maximum efficiency. Mindful awareness is not presented as a passive concentration on a single, steady object, but as a refined engagement with a shifting, complex world. Mindfulness is a skill that can be developed. It is a choice, an act, a response that springs from a quiet but curious intelligence. And it is empathetic, keenly sensitized to the peculiar texture of one’s own and others’ suffering.

Rather than dismiss the self as a fiction, Gotama presented it as a project to be realized. By “self” he referred not to the transcendent Self of the brahmins, which, by definition, cannot be anything other than what it eternally Is, but the functional, moral self that breathes and acts in this world.

The aim of mindfulness is to know suffering fully. It entails paying calm, unflinching attention to whatever impacts the organism, be it the song of a lark or the scream of a child, the bubbling of a playful idea or a twinge in the lower back. You attend not just to the outward stimuli themselves, but equally to your inward reactions to them. You do not condemn what you see as your failings or applaud what you regard as success. You notice things come, you notice them go. Over time, the practice becomes less a self-conscious exercise in meditation done at fixed periods each day and more a sensibility that infuses one’s awareness at all times. Mindfulness can have a sobering effect on the restless, jittery psyche. The stiller and more focused it becomes, the more I am able to peer into the sources of my febrile reactivity, to catch the first stirring of hatred before it overwhelms me with loathing and spite, to observe with ironic detachment the conceited babbling of the ego, to notice at its inception the self-demeaning story that could tip me into depression.

Mindfulness of suffering does not, however, lead to morbidity and despair. The more one internalizes a sense of the contingency of things, the less one is depressed and irked by pain (for it will pass) and the more one is awestruck by the presence of the simplest joys: to see a bud unfold, hear a wave rush over a beach, touch another person’s hand (these too will pass). As in great music, theater, and literature, the tragic sense of life evokes a strange, disquieting beauty. A self-portrait of Rembrandt, an adagio from a late Beethoven quartet, the agonies of King Lear do not depress but elevate me. They move me in my depths, arouse a keen perception of what it means to be alive rather than dead.

What is it that makes a person insist passionately on the existence of metaphysical realities that can be neither demonstrated nor refuted? I suppose some of it has to do with fear of death, the terror that you and your loved ones will disappear and become nothing. But I suspect that for such people, the world as presented to their senses and reason appears intrinsically inadequate, incapable of fulfilling their deepest longings for meaning, truth, justice, or goodness. Whether one believes in God or karma and rebirth, in both cases one can place one’s trust in a higher power or law that appears capable of explaining this fraught and brief life on earth. One assumes the existence of hidden forces that lie deep beneath the surface of the contingent and untrustworthy world of day-to-day experience. Many Buddhists would argue that to jettison belief in the law of karma—a scheme of moral bookkeeping mysteriously inhering within the structure of reality itself—would be tantamount to removing the foundations of ethics. Good acts would not be rewarded and evil deeds not punished. Theists have said exactly the same about the consequences of abandoning belief in God and divine judgment.

Whenever someone asks me whether I believe in God, I simply have no idea what the question means. Since those who ask tend to be educated and intelligent, I know they are not referring to a bearded old man sitting on a throne in the sky. But what are they referring to? I am just as puzzled by someone who says with equivalent conviction: “No, I do not believe in God.” What is it that they so emphatically do not believe in? The word God is such an ingrained cultural habit of speech that, as a native English speaker, it is assumed automatically that I know how to use it. “I rather find myself at a loss when a question of God is raised,” wrote Nanavira in a letter to Robert Brady. “I feel that I am expected to say something (even if it is only goodbye), and I don’t find anything to say.” I have read many theological tomes, which do their best to explain the meaning of God, but I am still not much the wiser. God is presented as the source and ground of everything. For Thomas Aquinas, God is esse ipsum: Being itself. But how do you believe in “the source and ground of everything” let alone in “Being itself”? The New Testament tells us that God is Love and that He sent his only begotten Son into the world. But how can the ultimate source and ground of everything have an emotion like “love” or an intention to “incarnate”? In what possible sense can Being itself be thought of as a Person? At this point, you learn that God is unknowable and utterly beyond any concept you can have of Him, that all descriptions of God are mere figures of speech, imperfect metaphors required to render intelligible something so mysterious and sublime that the human mind is incapable of ever grasping it. I had the funny feeling that I was being led around in circles.

But as soon as the object passes out of the field of vision or one shuts one’s eyes, that consciousness ceases. This is true of every kind of consciousness. “Just as a fire,” Gotama explained to Sati, “is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it burns—a log fire, a grass fire, a dung fire and so on—so too, consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition on which it arises.” Consciousness is an emergent, contingent, and impermanent phenomenon. It has no magical capacity to break free from the field of events out of which it springs. There are no wormholes in this intricate and fluid field through which one can wriggle out, either to reach union with God or move on to another existence after death. This is a field in which one is challenged to act; it is your actions alone that define you. There is no point in praying for divine guidance or assistance. That, as Gotama told Vasettha, would be like someone who wishes to cross the Aciravati River by calling out to the far bank: “Come here, other bank, come here!” No amount of “calling, begging, requesting or wheedling” will have any effect at all.

Don Cupitt called The Time Being. I was immediately impressed by the incisive, playful, and intensely personal quality of the writing. I was also astounded to find that Cupitt drew unapologetically on Buddhist sources, in particular Nagarjuna and Dogen, to make his case. I soon learned that Cupitt was a controversial, if not heretical, figure in the Christian world. In 1980, he had published a book entitled Taking Leave of God, in which he explicitly rejected any idea of God as a metaphysical reality existing outside the realm of human thought and language. Since then his views have become increasingly radical as he ruthlessly strips away the last remaining consolations of traditional religious belief. I became a keen admirer of his work. I have a greater affinity with Don Cupitt than with any living Buddhist thinker.

Nonetheless, old habits die hard. In my quest for the historical Buddha, I still keep catching myself in search of a perfect person: one who can do no wrong, whose every thought, word, and deed springs from infallible understanding. But Gotama cannot be perfect because he is not God. He did not exempt himself when he said that all things are impermanent, suffering, unreliable, and contingent. He tried to respond as best as he could to the situation at hand.

Yet apart from these primary perceptions, intuitions, inferences, and bits of information, the views that I hold about the things that really matter to me—meaning, truth, happiness, goodness, beauty—are finely woven tissues of belief and opinion. These views enable me to get by in my workaday world but would not stand up to a great deal of scrutiny from someone who was not sympathetic to them. Depending on how crucial they are to my integrity and credibility, I am prepared to defend some of them with greater vigor and passion than others. I drift and swim through life on a tide of derivative beliefs that I share with others who belong to the same kind of cultures as myself.

It depicts a ten-foot-high fisherman in oilskins gripping the wheel of his boat as he steers it through a North Atlantic storm. Yet to my Buddhist eyes this monument commemorating heroic American individualism showed a man holding an eight-spoked Wheel of Dhamma. The seeker of cod was transformed into a bodhisattva in search of awakening, guiding the boat of his precious human body by means of the eightfold path through the treacherous seas of samsara.

Gotama compares the Dhamma to a raft that one assembles from pieces of driftwood, fallen branches and other bits of rubbish. Once it has taken you across the river that lies in your way, you leave it behind on the bank for someone else and proceed on your way. The Dhamma is a temporary expedient. To treat it as an object of reverence is as absurd as carrying the raft on your back even though you no longer need it. To practice the Dhamma is like making a collage. You collect ideas, images, insights, philosophical styles, meditation methods, and ethical values that you find here and there in Buddhism, bind them securely together, then launch your raft into the river of your life. As long as it does not sink or disintegrate and can get you to the other shore, then it works. That is all that matters. It need not correspond to anyone else’s idea of what “Buddhism” is or should be.

W tym miejscu Derridiańska terminologia „śladu” wyraża fakt, że rzeczywistość (prawda) zawsze wymyka się naszemu myśleniu czy nawet naszemu doświadczeniu (które jest niemożliwe bez pewnej konceptualizacji). Mamy do niej dostęp jedynie jako do śladu, obecnego jedynie w niebezpośredni sposób, jako czegoś, na co nasza myśl i doświadczenie w jakiś sposób wskazuje, lecz nie jest w stanie wyrazić. Tę tezę można również ująć za pomocą innych terminów Derridy. Ta „śladowa-rzeczywistość” odnosi się do differance pomiędzy rzeczywistością a tym, co myślimy i doświadczamy, i jest koniecznym suplementem do tej myśli i doświadczenia. Teza Derridy głosi zatem nie to, że nie istnieje etyczna rzeczywistość, lecz że każdy bezpośredni dostęp, jaki do niej mamy, jest nieadekwatny do swego przedmiotu.

Natomiast religia jest tym, co otrzymujemy, gdy zinterpretujemy „innego” z wezwania Abrahama jako Boga jednego z historycznych religii, Boga, który nie jest już niedekonstruowalną granicą wszelkiej naszej myśli i doświadczenia, lecz bytem, który objawił się nam (czy przynajmniej części z nas) jako posiadający pewne określone cechy – wykonujący pewne określone działania, mający określone pragnienia, wydający określone nakazy. Dla religii to, co boskie jest obecnością, czymś „tutaj”, do czego mamy pozytywny dostęp, nawet jeśli tylko przez „przyciemnione szkło”. Derrida jest bardzo niechętny względem dalszego ruchu w stronę religii. Obawia się on, że religia absolutyzuje nasze ludzkie – nazbyt ludzkie – kategorie, utożsamiając innego z jakimś konkretnym sformułowaniem pojęciowym. Taka operacja daje Boga, który jest raczej kategorialny niż transcedentalny, Boga żydów, chrześcijan czy muzułmanów – krótko mówiąc, Boga, który jest refleksją, a nie nieosiągalną granicą myślenia i doświadczenia. Derrida sugeruje, że religia tak pojęta jest ostatecznie odmianą bałwochwalstwa.

dekonstrukcjonizm Derridy jest otwarty na religię w tym sensie, że centralne dlań skupienie się na innym może być z łatwością odczytane jako odniesienie do czegoś boskiego jako absolutnie transcendentnego, które jest oświecającą i ożywiającą granicą naszej myśli i doświadczenia. Nie jest jednak spójny z religią, która prezentuje samą siebie jako specyficzny środek dostępu do boskiej rzeczywistości, która w jakiś sposób staje się pozytywną, obecną i pojmowalną dla nas prawdą.

If Sera Monastery and Songgwangsa had not existed for centuries as bastions of their respective Buddhist traditions, would I have been able to receive the kind of education and training that provided me a foundation on which to write about Buddhism as I do now? I very much doubt it. Whether I like it or not, the animating spirit of religious life and its formal organization appear—like Buddha and Mara—to be inextricably entwined with each other. To reject organized religion in favor of a nebulous and eclectic “spirituality” is not a satisfactory solution either. As language users, we can no more cease trying to generate coherent theories and beliefs than a stomach can cease to digest food. As social animals we invariably organize ourselves into groups and communities. Without a rigorous, self-critical discourse, one risks lapsing into pious platitudes and unexamined generalizations. And without some sort of social cohesion, one’s brilliant ideas are liable to perish. The point is not to abandon all institutions and dogmas but to find a way to live with them more ironically, to appreciate them for what they are—the play of the human mind in its endless quest for connection and meaning—rather than timeless entities that have to be ruthlessly defended or forcibly imposed.

If, on the other hand, such passages are inventions that were later added to the Canon, one would have to answer the following questions: In whose interest would it have been to add such a human and tragic account of the Buddha’s life when the prevailing tendency—already apparent even in some suttas—was to represent him as a perfect figure adorned with superhuman features? And how would anyone have then managed to insert the details of this story in a scattershot manner throughout thousands of pages of text? When Buddhists did later come to compose discourses and attribute them to Siddhattha Gotama, it is striking that the texts they produced (i.e., the Mahāyāna Sūtras) are devoid of any sense of historical, social, or geographic reality. Moreover, the Buddha they present as delivering these discourses is godlike in his perfection, thereby causing the reader to lose any sense of his being a human person living in a world of conflict and uncertainty.

Sometimes Resistance takes the form of sex, or an obsessive preoccupation with sex. Why sex? Because sex provides immediate and powerful gratification.

Vipassana can be translated as “insight,” a clear awareness of exactly what is happening as it happens. Samatha can be translated as “concentration” or “tranquillity,” and is a state in which the mind is focused only on one item, brought to rest, and not allowed to wander. When this is done, a deep calm pervades body and mind, a state of tranquillity that must be experienced to be understood. Most systems of meditation emphasize the samatha component. The meditator focuses his or her mind on a certain item, such as a prayer, a chant, a candle flame, or a religious image, and excludes all other thoughts and perceptions from his or her consciousness. The result is a state of rapture, which lasts until the meditator ends the session of sitting. It is beautiful, delightful, meaningful, and alluring, but only temporary. Vipassana meditation addresses the other component: insight. The vipassana meditator uses concentration as a tool by which his or her awareness can chip away at the wall of illusion that blocks the living light of reality. It is a gradual process of ever-increasing awareness into the inner workings of reality itself. It takes years, but one day the meditator chisels through that wall and tumbles into the presence of light. The transformation is complete. It’s called liberation, and it’s permanent. Liberation is the goal of all Buddhist systems of practice. But the routes to the attainment of that end are quite diverse.

The Pali term for insight meditation is vipassana bhavana. Bhavana comes from the root bhu, which means to grow or to become. Therefore bhavana means to cultivate, and the word is always used in reference to the mind; bhavana means mental cultivation. Vipassana is derived from two roots. Passana means seeing or perceiving. Vi is a prefix with a complex set of connotations that can be roughly translated as “in a special way,” and also into and through “a special way.” The whole meaning of the word vipassana is looking into something with clarity and precision, seeing each component as distinct, and piercing all the way through to perceive the most fundamental reality of that thing. This process leads to insight into the basic reality of whatever is being examined. Put these words together and vipassana bhavana means the cultivation of the mind toward the aim of seeing in the special way that leads to insight and full understanding.

Even as you read these words, your body is aging. But you pay no attention to that. The book in your hand is decaying. The print is fading, and the pages are becoming brittle. The walls around you are aging. The molecules within those walls are vibrating at an enormous rate, and everything is shifting, going to pieces, and slowly dissolving. You pay no attention to that either. Then one day you look around you. Your skin is wrinkled and your joints ache. The book is a yellowed, faded thing; and the building is falling apart. So you pine for lost youth, cry when your possessions are gone. Where does this pain come from? It comes from your own inattention. You failed to look closely at life. You failed to observe the constantly shifting flow of the world as it passed by. You set up a collection of mental constructions—“me,” “the book,” “the building”—and you assumed that those were solid, real entities. You assumed that they would endure forever. They never do. But now you can tune into the constant change. You can learn to perceive your life as an ever-flowing movement. You can learn to see the continuous flow of all conditioned things. You can. It is just a matter of time and training. Our human perceptual habits are remarkably stupid in some ways. We tune out 99 percent of all the sensory stimuli we actually receive, and we solidify the remainder into discrete mental objects. Then we react to those mental objects in programmed, habitual ways.

You don’t need to figure everything out. Discursive thinking won’t free you from the trap. In meditation, the mind is purified naturally by mindfulness, by wordless bare attention. Habitual deliberation is not necessary to eliminate those things that are keeping you in bondage. All that is necessary is a clear, nonconceptual perception of what they are and how they work. That alone is sufficient to dissolve them. Concepts and reasoning just get in the way. Don’t think. See.

There is a difference between being aware of a thought and thinking a thought. That difference is very subtle. It is primarily a matter of feeling or texture. A thought you are simply aware of with bare attention feels light in texture; there is a sense of distance between that thought and the awareness viewing it. It arises lightly like a bubble, and it passes away without necessarily giving rise to the next thought in that chain. Normal conscious thought is much heavier in texture. It is ponderous, commanding, and compulsive. It sucks you in and grabs control of consciousness. By its very nature it is obsessional, and it leads straight to the next thought in the chain, with apparently no gap between them.

We sit, watching the air going in and out of our noses. At first glance, this seems an exceedingly odd and useless procedure. Before going on to specific instructions, let us examine the reason behind it. The first question we might have is why use any focus of attention at all? We are, after all, trying to develop awareness. Why not just sit down and be aware of whatever happens to be present in the mind? In fact, there are meditations of that nature. They are sometimes referred to as unstructured meditation, and they are quite difficult. The mind is tricky. Thought is an inherently complicated procedure. By that we mean that we become trapped, wrapped up, and stuck in the thought chain. One thought leads to another, which leads to another, and another, and another, and so on. Fifteen minutes later we suddenly wake up and realize we spent that whole time stuck in a daydream or sexual fantasy

There are meditation teachers who teach their students to follow the breath by watching the rise and fall of the abdomen. Others recommend focusing attention on the touch of the body against the cushion, or hand against hand, or the feeling of one leg against the other. The method we are explaining here, however, is considered the most traditional and is probably what Gotama Buddha taught his students. The Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha’s original discourse on mindfulness, specifically says that one must begin by focusing the attention on the breathing and then go on to note all other physical and mental phenomena that arise.

Breath is a phenomenon common to all living things. A true experiential understanding of the process moves you closer to other living beings. It shows you your inherent connectedness with all of life. Finally, breathing is a present-moment process. By that we mean it is always occurring in the here and now. We don’t normally live in the present, of course. We spend most of our time caught up in memories of the past or looking ahead to the future, full of worries and plans. The breath has none of that “other-timeness.” When we truly observe the breath, we are automatically placed in the present. We are pulled out of the morass of mental images and into a bare experience of the here and now. In this sense, breath is a living slice of reality. A mindful observation of such a miniature model of life itself leads to insights that are broadly applicable to the rest of our experience.

Make no attempt to control the breath. This is not a breathing exercise of the sort done in yoga. Focus on the natural and spontaneous movement of the breath. Don’t try to regulate it or emphasize it in any way. Most beginners have some trouble in this area. In order to help themselves focus on the sensation, they unconsciously accentuate their breathing. The result is a forced and unnatural effort that actually inhibits concentration rather than helping it. Don’t increase the depth of your breath or its sound. This latter point is especially important in group meditation. Loud breathing can be a real annoyance to those around you. Just let the breath move naturally, as if you were asleep. Let go and allow the process to go along at its own rhythm.

Somewhere in this process, you will come face to face with the sudden and shocking realization that you are completely crazy. Your mind is a shrieking, gibbering madhouse on wheels barreling pellmell down the hill, utterly out of control and helpless. No problem. You are not crazier than you were yesterday. It has always been this way, and you just never noticed. You are also no crazier than everybody else around you. The only real difference is that you have confronted the situation; they have not. So they still feel relatively comfortable.

Vipassana meditation is an active function. Concentration is a strong, energetic attention to one single item. Awareness is a bright clean alertness. Samadhi and sati—these are the two faculties we wish to cultivate. And sinking mind contains neither. At its worst, it will put you to sleep. Even at its best it will simply waste your time.

Meditation is a tough job. It is an inherently solitary activity. One person battles against enormously powerful forces, part of the very structure of the mind doing the meditating. When you really get into it, you will eventually find yourself confronted with a shocking realization. One day you will look inside and realize the full enormity of what you are actually up against. What you are struggling to pierce looks like a solid wall so tightly knit that not a single ray of light shines through. You find yourself sitting there, staring at this edifice, and you say to yourself, “That? I am supposed to get past that? But it’s impossible! That is all there is. That is the whole world. That is what everything means, and that is what I use to define myself and to understand everything around me, and if I take that away the whole world will fall apart and I will die. I cannot get through that. I just can’t.” It is a very scary feeling, a very lonely feeling. You feel like, “Here I am, all alone, trying to punch away something so huge it is beyond conception.” To counteract this feeling, it is useful to know that you are not alone. Others have passed this way before.

Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspiration. “I write only when inspiration strikes,” he replied. “Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o’clock sharp.”   That’s a pro.   In terms of Resistance, Maugham was saying, “I despise Resistance; I will not let it faze me; I will sit down and do my work.”   Maugham reckoned another, deeper truth: that by performing the mundane physical act of sitting down and starting to work, he set in motion a mysterious but infallible sequence of events that would produce inspiration, as surely as if the goddess had synchronized her watch with his.

In my younger days dodging the draft, I somehow wound up in the Marine Corps. There’s a myth that Marine training turns baby-faced recruits into bloodthirsty killers. Trust me, the Marine Corps is not that efficient. What it does teach, however, is a lot more useful.   The Marine Corps teaches you how to be miserable.   This is invaluable for an artist.   Marines love to be miserable. Marines derive a perverse satisfaction from having colder chow, crappier equipment, and higher casualty rates than any outfit of dogfaces, swab jockeys or flyboys, all of whom they despise. Why? Because these candy-asses don’t know how to be miserable.   The artist committing himself to his calling has volunteered for hell, whether he knows it or not. He will be dining for the duration on a diet of isolation, rejection, self-doubt, despair, ridicule, contempt, and humiliation.   The artist must be like that Marine. He has to know how to be miserable. He has to love being miserable. He has to take pride in being more miserable than any soldier or swabbie or jet jockey. Because this is war, baby. And war is hell.

A pro views her work as craft, not art. Not because she believes art is devoid of a mystical dimension. On the contrary. She understands that all creative endeavor is holy, but she doesn’t dwell on it. She knows if she thinks about that too much, it will paralyze her. So she concentrates on technique. The professional masters how, and leaves what and why to the gods.
